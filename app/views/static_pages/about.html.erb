    Ripple in a Pond was founded by Serena Xu and Rodrigo Manubens in late May 2014 at the Earthquake Resilience event, hosted by Swissnex SF. From his experiences working at different non-profit organizations in Chile, Rodrigo often saw the miscommunication between organizations and the people who want to donate to help. The vision for the project was to create a system to bridge that gap. The two continued to develop Ripple in a Pond in the months that followed. Soon to join the team was Manny Karyampudi and Erin Snyder, both who contributed greatly to the development process.
