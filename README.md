#Helping Hands
==============================

Helping Hands is a webapp that helps charities, NGO's and goverment organizations orchestrate relief efforts.

With Helping Hands, organizations issue 'promises', contracts that specify a particular need they have at any given time (ie the Salvation Army needs 300 buckets of white paint for a new shelter). Once these promises are created, any organization or individual can chip in to help fulfill that particular promise ( ie a local painter can promise to donate 5 buckets of white paint ).

These promises allow organizations to crowdsource their needs effectively and not waste precious resources sorting through unneeded donations and resources.

Helping Hands promises makes every little piece of help count
